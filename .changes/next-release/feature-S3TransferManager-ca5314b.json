    "description": "Extend [#5031](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-java-v2/pull/5031) by allowing user configuration of transferDirectoryMaxConcurrency during construction of S3TransferManager. This allows for more control of upper limits on JVM Heap memory allocation. See [#6330](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-java-v2/issues/6330)."
